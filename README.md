# Weather Dashboard App

## Description

This simple weather web app will allow you to search the weather, temperature, humidity and wind speed for the current date & forecast for upcoming five days.

The app was built using HTML, simple CSS (using a Bootstrap framework) and JavaScript. The primary aim for building this app was to demonstrate practical use of third-party API calls (e.g. for calling weather data).
